# A Powerful Self-Help Technique Combining Tapping Therapy and Free Association

December 2020. v1.0 by Lee Cooper

## What's this about?

Herein is presented a technique that will allow the vast majority of people to work
through emotional problems in the privacy of their own home, either alone or with an assistant.

The technique requires only one or two hours to learn, but more practice to
perfect.

With this technique it is possible to increase communication with the subconscious mind, experience new emotions not previously experienced, make leaps of understanding regarding issues in your life and discover new perspectives.

I thoroughly recommend anyone interested in the workings of the mind or personal
development, or anyone dealing with stresses or emotional problems to give it a try. The only cost is your time.

**Good luck!**

## The Technique

### The Technique - Overview

There are two parts to the technique:

1. Learn and practice the 'tapping therapy' known as 'Emotional Freedom Technique
   ‘EFT’ [1]. The technique involves tapping on various parts of
   the body whilst repeating fixed phrases that address negative
   feelings you are experiencing. I did not develop Emotional Freedom
   Technique, and will not go into detail on it here. I will not
   explain the theory behind it as it is not a prerequisite to use it
   successfully. It is not a faith based technique, so you don't need
   to 'believe in it.' Simply follow the process and you should see
   results.

2. Apply the
   Emotional Freedom Technique with a focus on free association and
   tapping on whatever comes up WITH NO FILTER or VALUE JUDGEMENT on
   the material that is experienced. More on this later.

### The Technique - Detail

**Stage 1 -
Learning EFT**

You can learn the
EFT tapping technique from the creator's website at the address here: [How to do the EFT Tapping Basics - The Basic Recipe | PART I For Everyone: The EFT Tapping Basics | Official EFT Tutorial](https://www.emofree.com/eft-tutorial/tapping-basics/how-to-do-eft.html)

Follow the
instructions in the linked document. You only need to understand the
'basic recipe' and there is no need to read the section on 'Other
Tapping Points and Routines' for our purposes.

It is strongly
recommended that you practice the basic recipe before proceeding
further. It is important to commit the simple routine to memory until
it becomes a reflex as having to remind yourself what you're doing or
think about it too much will interrupt the experience. You should be
able to learn it in an hour, but of course practice makes perfect.

**Stage 2 -
Applying free association and the 'no judgement' rule**

The technique is
extremely simple:

- Apply
   successive rounds of the EFT tapping 'basic recipe' you have learnt.
   You can begin with a recommended phrase that encompasses the issue
   you are trying to deal with, alternatively just say whatever leaps
   to your mind as you tap. Personally I usually don't assess the
   intensity of my emotions on the 1-10 scale. Whilst it can be useful,
   I find it interrupts the process and the stream of thought.

- As the tapping
   process continues, your thoughts will change. All you have to do is
   tap on each thought as it comes up and follow the stream of thought.

- DO NOT make a
   conscious decision on what to accept as part of the process and what
   to reject.

Congratulations,
you now know how to combine EFT with free association.!

Simple,
isn't it?

The
devil, however, is in the detail.

YOU
MUST STICK TO THE **GOLDEN
RULE!**

## The

Golden Rule

The Golden Rule for
successfully applying free association is this:

"Do
not make a conscious decision on what to accept as part of the
process and what to reject."

So what is the point
here? The point is, that the conscious mind, let's say 'the ego' has
a habit of getting in the way and distracting us when we try to get
to the root of the problem. The way to deal with this is simply to
follow the golden rule and tap on any thoughts that come up,
regardless of content, even if they seem to be nothing to do with
what you’re trying to work on.

This is best
illustrated by some examples...

You're tapping on a
problem and the thought comes to your mind that you need to clean the
house up. You could try to ignore it and hope it goes away, you could
make a great effort not to think about it, but ultimately trying to
suppress it is likely to make the thought even more intrusive, and is
essentially an act of trying to battle one thought with another; the
direct opposite of our aim… we seek integration!

You simply tap on
this 'I need to clean the house up' and keep tapping on it until the
next thought comes up. This is not a waste of time, it is part of the
process.

By following the
Golden Rule, we allow all aspects of the mind to contribute. The
Golden Rule allows all aspects of the mind to 'have their say.'
Nothing is to be suppressed. To do so would be to suppress the
progress, because the same blocker will repeatedly emerge.

Now some common
sense is required here. Obviously if there's something pressing that
needs doing, you can't tap your way around it. Tap on 'the dinner is
burning and I need to take it off the hob' as much as you like and it
is unlikely to stop intruding... it's something that needs to be
done. Similarly if you hear a car horn outside and it distracts you,
by all means tap on what comes to mind, for example 'I'm trying to
tap and this horn interrupted.' All well and good, but again if the
noise from the car is continual, this distraction is going to hinder
your progress and there is no point trying to ‘tap your way out of
it.’ For this reason, it is important to make time and space to
follow the process. Allot yourself sufficient time to immerse
yourself (I recommend at least an hour, even if you don't end up
using it all), and ensure you have a space free of external
interruptions and noise.

Suppose you are
tapping and you feel you're wasting your time and getting nowhere-
don't give up so easily. Remember the golden rule and tap on it.
"This is crap and I'm getting nowhere." I have had similar
thoughts come up a number of times in a session prior to making real
progress. I wouldn't have got there without acknowledging the
thoughts and tapping through. It can take many rounds of tapping if
the thought is persistent.

It can occur that
you tap through a persistent thought and move on, only for it to
reappear again some time later. Don't be disheartened if this
happens. THIS IS TO BE EXPECTED!

These things serve
as a defence from getting to the core of the issue, but again, do not
ignore or attempt to 'get around it.' Just follow the golden rule and
tap on it. As new, deeper levels of the issue are revealed, old
defences can reappear. They work together in a dynamic fashion. Just
keep on tapping through, and if you're frustrated because something
came back, don't reject that thought... it's part of the stream. "I'm
sick of this issue coming back", "I'm sick of this issue
coming back", "This is boring", "I'm tired."
Just keep on tapping as it presents itself.

If you're tapping
with someone to assist, for example a friend or therapist talking you
through the tapping points as you voice your thoughts aloud,
something can come up that you don't feel comfortable to say in front
of them.. and again, this is another block. Ideally you can discuss
your concerns with the therapist and reach an agreement and comfort
to talk freely. If not, then it is better to tap alone.

When we discuss that
nothing is to be rejected or filtered, it is to be understood that
the intent to allow all thoughts to be expressed and tapped on. This
does not mean you have to 'be okay' or agree with all the thoughts
that come up, it just means that you acknowledge the thought, voice
it (either verbally or in your head) and tap on it. If an unsavoury
thought comes up and you have a conscious reaction to it, for example
"This isn't me," or "that's disgusting," again
don't reject that judgement... just tap on it. In some instances this
can lead to a 'back and forth' dialogue between your conscious mind
and expressions bubbling up from the subconscious. Just allow it to
occur, tapping on each expression as it arises.

The 'basic recipe'
of EFT talks about creating tapping phrases that focus on negative
emotions. With the free association technique, it is perfectly
possible that positive emotions come up. Follow the golden rule- tap
on the positive material that comes up. It's part of the stream of
consciousness just like all the rest, so we do not reject it.

The 'basic recipe'
also talks about not wanting to focus on 'someone else's issue,' and
uses the issue of a son who is addicted to drugs. Now it is pointless
to tap on yourself in an attempt to cure someone else, but within the
framework of EFT with free association, it is not only okay to tap on
someone else's issue if it emerges spontaneously within your flow of
thought, it is imperative. To do otherwise would violate the golden
rule. It's not about curing the son, it's about allowing your mind to
express itself freely on a subject that demands expression.

Emotions and imagery
arise in addition to internal verbal thoughts. The golden rule
applies to everything. Don't try to run from any emotion, just tap on
it, and use a phrase like “this sadness,” Allow yourself to feel
each emotion and tap on it... and if you get angry because you
disagree with an emotion that has bubbled up, for example compassion
for someone who has been abusive towards you, follow the golden rule
and tap on the anger when it arises. Remember that compassion towards
someone who has wronged you is okay. It does not imply that what they
did was 'okay,' nor does it mean you should 'act like nothing
happened' or put yourself back in harm's way by continuing a
relationship.

Other distracting
feelings can include “I’m getting nowhere,” “am I doing this
right.” Just follow the Golden Rule and they will pass. Baby
noises, laughing, ‘gobbledygook,’ bizarre images.. the things
that can emerge are as limitless as thought itself. Just apply the
Golden Rule and tap on it all.

Okay, I've banged on
about the Golden Rule long enough now. Please bear in mind are just
some examples. The mind is very clever in its distractions.

## A Selection of the Author's Experiences

For many years I had
a recurring dream where I was driving a car on a public road, whilst
controlling a second full-sized car by remote control. I was able to
cope with this, but other traffic on the road began getting in the
way and as time proceeded the remote control car was getting further
and further ahead of my vehicle until it was almost at the horizon
and the task of keeping it from crashing was becoming impossible. I
didn't think much of the dream but it did make me a little anxious.
Whilst tapping on something unrelated, I felt I needed to move my
arm, and a spontaneous involuntary movement of my arm somehow
connected me to the memory of this dream, and instantly the answer
came to me- it was a representation about me planning far into the
future without planning the more immediate steps to get to where I
wanted. This wasn't an act of guessing, or reasoning it out, it was
an instantaneous flash of knowing.

I have suffered from
self-esteem issues in the past, and during EFT I had an experience of
feeling brilliant.. then even beyond brilliant. For several minutes I
experienced what I can only describe as intense narcissism, like 'I'm
the shit. I'm the best. Better than anyone else. Look at me.' Not
just words here, an incredibly powerful feeling that emerged. Now
obviously narcissism is not true self love and is a pathological
emanation rather than a positive thing, but the point here is, you
can experience deep new emotions with this technique. I tapped
through it and it passed, as it needed to.

It's useful to be
aware of the 'transference' phenomenon which can appear with this
technique. I was working with an EFT therapist and several sessions
in I became attracted to her. Within the space of 15 minutes, I was
besotted with her. Now she was an attractive, likeable woman, but the
intensity of these feelings out of nowhere began to strike me as
something unhealthy. Long story short, as I tapped through the
feelings my emotions towards her became very negative and it became
apparent that these were feeling from earlier in life towards someone
else. This projection of emotions onto someone involved with the
therapeutic process is to be expected. You should work with someone
who understands this and allows you to express these feelings (with
of course, the understanding that it's not something personal) or
work alone.

The story my mind
created during my tapping sessions regularly involved the appearance
of a ‘Jester’ character. I find this interesting because the
Jester archetype is one that regularly appears during experiences
with psychedelic medicines such as Ayahuasca which are currently a
hot topic at esteemed universities across the world, under research
for their healing power in relation to the full gamut of emotional
problems, for example PTSD and depression. Since I had no knowledge
of this history of the Jester archetype at the time, it cannot be
explained away by expectation.

Continued work with
the technique revealed that this jester character to be something
created by myself at a very difficult time in my very early life,
either consciously or unconsciously, I do not know, that served a
protective function – the mind’s method of coping with that with
which I could not cope. In that capacity it served it’s purpose,
however whilst not apparent to my consciousness as a Jester, this
subconscious ‘personality fragment’ if we can call it that would
cause me to respond in an inappropriate manner in certain
interpersonal relationships, damaging them in the process. It
literally wasn’t consciously apparent to me how I had acted, and I
always believed the other party had merely lost interest in me.

So there you have
it, a few of my more interesting experiences by way of illustrating
the power of this method.

## Precautions

Be wary of taking
everything that comes up literally. Formerly subconscious fears,
beliefs etc. can all come up, and the experience previously mentioned
of emotions projected onto a therapist should illustrate that not
everything is always what it seems. Work through it and hopefully
clarity will emerge in time.

## Disclaimers and Final Thoughts

There you have it.
This is a therapeutic technique that should be accessible to most
people without excessive effort, although do understand it can take
time to really ‘dig deep’ into the mind.

As previously
mentioned, I did not invent the concept of EFT, nor am I formally
qualified or associated with any official body of EFT.

I discovered the use
and principles of free association alongside EFT whilst working with
the latter and find it to be an extremely powerful combination. I do
not claim to be the first or only one to discover it; honestly I
haven't investigated, nor do I care. I'm someone who found a cool
thing and wanted to share. Nothing more, nothing less.

**Remember,
the mind is the power,**

**There
are many keys.**

**This
is just one.**

**Good
luck.**
